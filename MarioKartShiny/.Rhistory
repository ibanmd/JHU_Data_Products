A little Mario Kart data analysis
========================================================

Have you ever...
========================================================
Have you ever written down the results for 1600 Mario Kart
Races 64 races with your friend and had the following questions? :
- How do I present this data so everyone can see it?
- How do I find an easy way to graphically present the data?
- What if I don't know how to analyze my own data?
There is good news!
========================================================
Lucky for you Mario Kart fans out there, the Mario Kart
Shiny is here!
And it's very easy to use, check out the next slide for a
quick glimpse!
A nice ggplot has been set up for your ease of use!
========================================================
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
mariokart <- read.csv("MarioKart64.csv")
ggDensity <- ggplot(mariokart, aes(x=MatchPoints, fill=Racer)) + geom_density(alpha=.3)
ggDensity
```
***
This particular plot is a ggplot of the distribution of total match points between two rival racers.  In the interactive shiny, you are able to manipulate many settings and watch as the graph responds!
In conclusion..
========================================================
I hope that you see there is hope in analyzing your Mario
Kart 64 data, as this working example clearly shows.
Please take a moment and check it out!
