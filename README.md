# JHU_Data_Products

This repository is for the Johns Hopkins Coursera class, Data Products. 

### A little bit about the data:
It was recorded over the course of a year and consists of 100 Mario Kart 64 matches between the same two players, each match containing each of the 16 races.  The data primarily contains who won each race, cup, and match, and how many points were scored.

### The pitch
This R Presenation was put together in just a few minutes, by no means a quality job, but was just to complete the minimum project requirements.
